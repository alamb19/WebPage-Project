<p class="p1"> ok so if someone does not know what a furry is it is apparently a person who feels that they identify with or are more comfortable dressing up in an animal costume. Now you may be wondering if this is a real thing because it sounds so incredibly strange. I assure you that, it is real. In fact it is so real and popular that there is a furry convention: furry con. This may sound unrelated to anything about the internet or things brought about from the internet, but in fact, there were no furries until the internet came about. I personally find this fine. It's very odd but do what you want as long as you don't do anything harmful to other people or actual animals. But also just, why? <br><br> why?</p>
<p class="p2">Also if interested or just for fun this is a website where you can find your fursona—furry persona—based on your name <a href="https://en.shindanmaker.com/524641">(fursona generator)</a>
