 <p class="p1"> Facebook began when Myspace died. When kids thought that Myspace wasn't cool anymore they moved on and went to Facebook. It was a good place to have connections with your friends and no adult understood how it worked. Since then it has become a web center for moms. Every mom has a Facebook. Many of them share "memes" about the minions from despicable me. No one likes Facebook now. That's really the only thing that happened to Facebook. It just kind of died out when the older generations moved in.</p><br>
