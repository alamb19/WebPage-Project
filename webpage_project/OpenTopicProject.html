    <div class="internet"> <img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/592681ccf3e2356fd800981c/master/w_4000,c_limit/Mirai-01.jpg" style="width:31%"></div>
    <p class="p1">The beginning of the internet was the 90s. According to Wikipedia, "Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990, and the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic." I don't know what any of that means but it's a lot of words about the internet that is very unimportant to this website.</p>
    <p class="p2">The internet started out as a very sweet innocent place where people could email their friends or buy airplane tickets. Now there are some terrifying parts of the web that schools and parents often block from their children and for good reason.
