    <p class="p1">Everything on this website has about five layers of irony. It goes overboard with fandoms and goes into many many fanwars because of it, not unlike twitter. The main difference between this site and twitter though is more than fanwars. This place goes too far. I have seen things, things that a 16 year old girl would not have seen in her day 20 years ago. Even the accounts that are seemingly the sweetest, kindest, and most innocent will post things that go too far. I love tumblr, but not <i>all</i> of tumblr.</p>
