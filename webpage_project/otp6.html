<h2> The Beauty Community</h2>
<div class="photo"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_9M0svCoho/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="beauty" style="width:27%"></div>
<p class="p1"> The beauty community originated on Youtube with videos by people like Michelle Phan and Zoella who shared their makeup tips and lifestyle info. As the internet evolved and things like Instagram became popular people moved over to clips on Twitter and Instagram to share their passion. The beauty community is still very practical and interesting sometimes, but in this day and age, it is incredibly weird. Beauty Community, I do not want to put a fork on my nose. Please let me live</p>
